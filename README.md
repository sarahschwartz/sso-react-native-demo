Demo template app for ZKsync SSO React Native SDK.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have installed the [dependencies](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) needed for React Native for iOS.

Then, install the repo dependencies and run/build the project with:

```bash
npm install
npm ios:device
```

Select your device to test the complete application.

To simply start the server without rebuilding the pods, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Use the QR code to open the development build.
