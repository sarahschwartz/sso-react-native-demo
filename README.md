## Running Locally

Make sure you have installed the [dependencies](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) needed for React Native for iOS.

You also need to have your associated domain and App ID configured.

Plug in your device, install the repo dependencies, and build a development build the project with:

```bash
npm install
npm run ios:device
```

Select your device.

If you can see your app running, great!
If you just see the Expo splash screen,
stop the server.

In your phone settings, go to Privacyâ€¯&â€¯Securityâ€¯â†’â€¯LocalÂ Network â†’ enable the switch for your devâ€‘build app.
Then run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Use the QR code to open the development build.
